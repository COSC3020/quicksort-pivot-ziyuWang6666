# Quicksort Pivots

in the lectures I only briefly mentioned strategies for determining a good pivot
for quicksort. The implementation on the slides simply picks the leftmost
element in the part of the array that we consider as a pivot. I also mentioned a
few other ways of picking a good pivot, e.g. randomly.

Median-of-three is also a good way of picking a pivot -- inspect the first,
middle, and last elements of the part of the array under consideration and
choose the median value. Using the probabilities for picking a pivot in a
particular part of the array (in the same way as we did on slide 34), argue
whether this method is more or less (or equally) likely to pick a good pivot
compared to simply choosing the first element. Assume that all permutations are
equally likely, i.e. the input array is ordered randomly.

Your answer must derive probabilities for choosing a good pivot and
quantitatively reason with them.

might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.
